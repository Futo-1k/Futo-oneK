              that changes lives, improves our campus, and strengthens the FUTO
              community. Sounds exciting, right? Thatâ€™s the heart of the FUTO
              1K Challengeâ€”a simple but powerful way for everyone, from

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-7 mb-4">
              The FUTO 1K Challenge is an initiative to rally the FUTO community
              around a shared goal: raising funds to support essential projects,
              events, and resources that benefit all of us. By contributing
              just â‚¦1,000, youâ€™re not just giving moneyâ€”youâ€™re investing in the
              future of FUTO and helping to create opportunities that leave a
              lasting impact.

                <strong>Itâ€™s Affordable for Everyone:</strong> â‚¦1,000 might not
                seem like much, but when hundreds or thousands of people
                contribute, it adds up to something extraordinary!

                events, or helping fellow students in need.
